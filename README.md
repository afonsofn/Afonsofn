From self-taught beginnings, I've advanced to collaborating with software houses and leading firms, always emphasising the delivery of **top-quality** products to our customers.
I relocated to Europe in pursuit of fresh professional experiences, diving into varied technological environments. My aim has always been to broaden my perspective and **amplify the impact I bring to the projects I contribute to**.
As a developer, I seek a deeper understanding of the product to continually enhance its value and **better assist my team!**
